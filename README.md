### 3. What is the Passover?

### *Exodus 12, It was put into place by Aaron and Moses who were commanded by God. Rememberance is a large part of what the Passover meal is about.*

### *Summarizing the story:*
> What was the first thing to do for the passover meal?
> *"(Slay the) lamb at the Jerusalem temple, where the blood would be sprinkled on the altar. Then they went to celebrate the meal with their families or other companions in groups of at least 10 people" (Standard Lesson Commentary 274).* 

> Next, what do the disciples do?
> They sit at a reclining table in Jerusalem and begin to partake in this feast.

> Then, Jesus says something to the disciples?
> v. 21 "Truly I tell you..." The disciples are distraught, and all begin to as Jesus if they are the betrayer. 

> Jesus refers to himself as the son of man, why would Jesus's meaning be lost on his disciples? 
> According to the Standard Lesson Commentary the son of man referenced in Daniel 7 was seen as more of an enigmatic phrase (mysterious; difficult to interpret https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/)

> What do you think the meaning of Daniel 7 is?

### ** "13 â€œIn my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man,[a] coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. 14 He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed" (NIV Daniel 7:13-14).**

> Do you see Jesus as a king? Does your allegiance, a word that Mathew Bates in *Salvation by Allegiance Alone* translates pistis (word used in Paul's letters and traditionally translated to faith), to Jesus apply to the spiritual spheres of your life, the physical spheres of your life, or something else?
>  Both the spiritual and physical aspects of my life are ruled by Jesus.

> Jesus asked them to take and eat the bread in rememberance of him, and then out of the 4 cups they would take for this meal, he seemingly took the 3rd cup and says that "this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" (27-28). What are some parallels we can draw between Jesus's blood and the blood of the lamb?
